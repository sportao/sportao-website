                            <p>This founder came to Sportao operating at $70,000–$80,000 per month in revenue, but despite the topline, the business was <strong>losing money every month</strong>. The founder was overwhelmed and uncertain about the future.</p>
                            <p>The brand carried $60,000–$70,000 in Shopify Capital debt, and the founder was seriously considering shutting down the business altogether. To make matters worse, there was no clear accounting system, and the founder didn't know what he owed in sales taxes—creating hidden liabilities and increasing stress.</p>

                            <p>This brand was created by a former infantryman and father of six whose family relied entirely on the business for income. Despite generating $70,000–$80,000 per month in revenue, the business was barely profitable—just $8,000–$9,000 a month, with thin margins and constant operational overwhelm.</p>
                            <p>The real burden was the debt: <strong>nearly $200,000 in Shopify Capital debt</strong>, plus another $20,000 owed to a growth agency. The founder felt ashamed and overwhelmed, often unsure how he would sustain his family under the financial pressure.</p>
