## CASE STUDY 1 — E-commerce Brand 1

### From Overwhelmed and in Debt to Profitable, Stable, and Growing

**Background: A Brand on the Brink**

E-commerce Brand 1 came to Sportao operating at $70,000–$80,000 per month in revenue, but despite the topline, the business was losing money every month. The founder was overwhelmed and uncertain about the future. The brand carried $60,000–$70,000 in Shopify Capital debt, and the founder was seriously considering shutting down the business altogether.

To make matters worse, there was no clear accounting system, and the founder didn’t know what he owed in sales taxes, creating hidden liabilities and increasing stress. The business was unpredictable—about $300,000 per year in inconsistent revenue—with no financial clarity and no roadmap toward sustainable profitability.

---

**HURT: Financial Chaos, Overwhelm, and Uncertainty**
- Significant Shopify Capital debt ($60K–$70K)
- Losing money even at $70K–$80K monthly revenue
- No accounting system, no clarity on sales tax liabilities
- The founder was overwhelmed and confused, lacking financial literacy tools
- Business was unpredictable and unsustainable
- The founder was close to abandoning e-commerce entirely

---

**HEAL: Building Financial Stability, Clarity, and Control**

Sportao approached E-commerce Brand 1 with a stabilization-first strategy. Instead of pushing growth, we:

**1. Established a Real Financial Framework**
    - Implemented structured accounting and tax tracking systems
    - Centralized banking under one dedicated account
    - Introduced a business-only credit card to properly categorize all expenses
    - Provided clear financial reporting so the founder finally understood the true numbers

**2. Tackled Sales Tax Confusion**
    - Calculated outstanding sales tax obligations
    - Educated the founder on how sales tax works
    - Integrated ongoing compliance into the financial workflow

**3. Provided Founder Education and Support**
Sportao’s core belief is: “We build people who build businesses.”

We didn’t just fix the issues—we taught the founder how to:
    - Understand his financial statements
    - Forecast profitably
    - Make decisions with confidence

**4. Provided Access to Support Teams**
The founder was no longer alone. Sportao provided:
    - A financial operations team
    - A growth strategy team
    - Access to DL Media’s top-tier creative and paid ads operators

All at partnership-based terms he could not get anywhere else.

**HELP: A Profitable, Confident Founder and a Multi-Million Dollar Path**

Today, E-commerce Brand 1:
    - Runs at 20%–30% net profit margin every month
    - Has over $100,000 in the bank
    - Generates consistent, stable cash flow
    - Has clear financial controls, growth plans, and predictable operations
    - Is positioned to scale into a multi-million-dollar brand

The founder:
    - Gained financial literacy and confidence
    - Can now run his business with clarity and control
    - Left the chaos and overwhelm behind
    - Has a pathway to freedom rather than stress

E-commerce Brand 1 moved from an unstable $300K/year operation toward becoming a thriving, well-run, profitable brand with a future.

## CASE STUDY 2 — E-commerce Brand 2

### From $200K in Debt and Founder Burnout to Financial Stability, Positive Cash Flow, and a Brighter Future

**Background: A Founder Carrying the Weight Alone**

E-commerce Brand 2 was created by a former infantryman and father of six whose family relied entirely on the business for income. Despite generating $70,000–$80,000 per month in revenue, the business was barely profitable—just $8,000–$9,000 a month, with thin margins and constant operational overwhelm.

The real burden was the debt:
    - Nearly $200,000 in Shopify Capital debt
    - Another $20,000 owed to a growth agency

The founder felt ashamed and overwhelmed, often unsure how he would sustain his family under the financial pressure.

---

**HURT: Crushing Debt, Thin Margins, and Complete Overwhelm**
- $200K in Shopify Capital debt + $20K owed to an agency
- Low net margins
- No financial controls
- Founder drowning in operational demands
- No access to credit due to debt and poor credit score
- Emotional strain: shame, fear, uncertainty about supporting six kids

Without intervention, the business—and his family’s stability—were at serious risk.

**HEAL: Instant Margin Gains, New Financial Controls, and a Team Behind Him**

Sportao stepped in to stabilize and transform the business.

**1. Renegotiated Supplier Costs**
Using Sportao’s enterprise-level pricing, we immediately improved E-commerce Brand 2’s cost of goods, raising margins to 20%–30% net profit.

This alone created thousands of dollars in monthly savings.

**2. Introduced Financial Controls**
We established:
    - Clear accounting and reporting
    - Centralized banking
    - Clean expense categorization
    - Ongoing financial operations support

**3. Provided a Line of Credit**
This was critical.

Due to existing debt and poor credit, the founder had no ability to buy inventory or cover key expenses. Sportao provided a line of credit that allowed him to:
    - Purchase inventory
    - Pay operating expenses
    - Stay alive long enough to recover

This broke the vicious debt cycle.

**4. Added Support Teams**
We brought in:
    - A financial operations team
    - A growth strategy team
    - DL Media’s elite creative + media buying pod

He was no longer alone, and the emotional relief was immediate.

Within 2–3 months:
    - E-commerce Brand 2 paid off the entire Shopify debt
    - The business became consistently profitable
    - Cash flow turned positive
    - Remaining obligations were paid down

The founder:
    - Moved from shame and stress to confidence and stability
    - Learned how to run a financially disciplined operation
    - Could finally see a secure future for his family

Today, E-commerce Brand 2 is:
    - Financially healthy
    - Scalable
    - Backed by a team of operators who support sustainable long-term growth

This isn’t just a business turnaround—it’s a family transformation.
